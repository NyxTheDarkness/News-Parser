# News-Parser
Okay, so this script uses the https://github.com/codelucas/newspaper library to read news sites, generate a summary and parse keywords in the article, if it has a match it saves the title, date, generated summary, keywords and the articles URL.
I'm planning on later maybe making it send an email with the articles.
